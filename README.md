SEARCH ENGINE
1. List of classes, with a description.

I have 3 classes, one for the gui and where the comparing of the search input and file content gets compared, one to read the files and store their content in an array, and the control to just call both of these classes.
-Control.java class : contains main function which will run the code from the GUI class and the readfiles class.
-ReadFiles.java class : contains the code which will read through my five files(CARS,COLOURS,PETS,COLOURSOFTHERAINBOW,ANIMALS) and then store the contents of each file into a seperate array so that it can be used to be compared to the search the user enters in.
GUI.java class : contains code that creates the GUI interface. I made a simple search engine layout,using buttons, jtextfield and labels. Then used actionlistener to make these features do something on click. for example, clicking the show all files button will display all the files that are being read through.

2. Description of the core functionality you included;-- I didn't get it fully working, the user was meant to type in their search into jtextfield and click the search button which would then compare the input to the contents of the files. The reason why i couldnt get my code to work was becuase i needed to use the array from my readfile class in my gui class, but for some reason, this part would not work for me, and therefore i couldnt move further with my project and allow it to actually search and compare. I think if i had more time i could have got this to fully work.

3. Description/list of the optional functionality you included-- i included a feature that would allow the user to view all the files that exist and would be read through, i felt like this would be a good feature to have just in case the user wanted to manually look for something themselves.
4. Explain what you would add if you had more time.-- if i had more time, i would add a feature to check for spelling mistakes in the search, and probably a button to clear the jtextfield when the user clicks on it.
